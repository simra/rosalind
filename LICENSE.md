Look, don't be stupid. I wrote this code in my spare time, to learn a bit about bioinformatics.  
I hope you will learn something from it too.
Code is free for anyone to use/modify/redistribute, but for the love of learning don't use it to do your homework.
That is all.

[Also, I make no claims as to correctness for any task. Not even the task of solving Rosalind problems.]
Have fun!
